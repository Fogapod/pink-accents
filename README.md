# pink-accents

Accent system based on string pattern matching.

This is a silly accent system inspired by Space Station 13 accents. Maybe this thing has other uses, we'll see.
In it's core it's basically a re.sub call.

This was a part of PINK Discord bot originally: https://github.com/Fogapod/pink

Examples of accents can be found in `examples` folder.
